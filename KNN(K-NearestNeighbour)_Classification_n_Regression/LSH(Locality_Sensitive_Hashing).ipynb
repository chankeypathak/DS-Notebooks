    "In this technique we divide the Data Points present in space into Slices like pizza slices then for Each Slice we will calculate Hash value and put all the Data points of one slice into one bucket of hash table, If query point is given its hash value is generated and lookedup in the hash table with the generated value, The value of this key will be the all the data points i.e slice in which query point is present, so We will calculate KNN on these data points instead of calculating KNN on whole data set, so that Time Complexity and Space Complexity are Reduced.<br>\n",
